# CS290_HW1
OSU - CS 290 - HW Assignment 1


This week's assignment is to get set up with node on engineering server and GitHub. It is primarily a technical hurdle that needs to be overcome. We will go into details of node.js in week 7 module when we start to learn server side interactions.  For now, you only need to get the node running.  If all steps go smoothly, this assignment should be a 20 minute process, but be prepared for things to not go smoothly. Make sure to get started early on this as it can take awhile to troubleshoot problems.

From last year, we started to run the node on engineering server instead of Amazon server. So far, students don't have too much trouble getting it done smoothly.  Just follow every step in the tutorial  (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.and don't make careless mistakes.  If you run into any issues, please check/post on Piazza for clarifications.

 

Requirements:

Set up Node on Engineering servers
Start the Node.js process
Create a GitHub account (and I would highly recommend requesting a student dev pack as well from https://education.github.com/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site., you get a premium account for free and some other neat software.) If you already have an account, you can use that one for this course and do not need to create a new one.
Create a GitHub repository and add some contents to it
 

Deliverables:

Submit the following two addresses on Canvas as text.

The address where we can access Node on Engineering Servers. (This will be an URL in the form of http://flipX.engr.oregonstate.edu:YYYY, where flipX should be flip1, flip2, or flip3, and YYYY is the port number you choose, for example, 5678.) After following all the steps,  once you go to view the webpage flipX.engr.oregonstate.edu:YYYY, the page displays "MySql results...", that means your link is working and the forever process is up.
A link to your GitHub repository where you have added OSU-CS290-Tester as a collaborator (you do not need to wait for the response from the Collaborator)
This repository should have at least 2 files (any file type or content works) added to it.
 

Some tips on setting up the node:

1. Before you start the first step, connect to OSU VPN and keep the VPN connection during the whole setup process.

2. You do not need to change your default password and I think it is better to leave it as default since if something is not working for you, TAs and I can test your account on our side.

3. If you do change the default password, you need to update it in the dbcon.js file.

4. When you try one port number and it is not working, you need to switch to another port number by repeating from step 5.

5. Do not have any typo when you change the file content.
